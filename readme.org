This repository contains the external javascript for the
FullMoviesOnYoutube channels.

* Development Setup HowTo
  - Install git, and clone this repository
  - Install [[https://nodejs.org/][nodejs]], and add the location of *npm* to your PATH
    environment variable
  - Install [[http://gulpjs.com/][gulp]]
  - Install these dependencies through npm by calling
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    npm install
    #+END_SRC

    From here, you can run *gulp js* to start watching and generating
    the out/fmoyt-external.js file

** Development server
   To monitor development and test changes you perform on the code,
   you need to start a node server at the root of the github
   repository
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server -p 80
   #+END_SRC

   Then you can browse to the webpage
   [[http://cytu.be/r/fullmoviesonyoutubedev]]

   This page looks for the external js and external css through your
   local server on port 80.
